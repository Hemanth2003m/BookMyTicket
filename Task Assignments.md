---

## ğŸ“¦ Integration Tasks (Shared Responsibilities)
- Merge individual Swing UIs with backend logic
- Ensure thread-safe booking logic (seat locking, updates)
- Perform unit and integration testing
- Maintain consistent UI design and UX
- Weekly integration review and merge planning

## ğŸ“‹ Files and Components per Task

| Task | File(s) to Build |
|--------|------------------|
| 1 | `LoginForm.java`, `User.java`, `AuthManager.java` |
| 2 | `TrainForm.java`, `Train.java`, `RouteManager.java` |
| 3 | `CompartmentNode.java`, `SeatTree.java`, `Seat.java` |
| 4 | `BookingRequest.java`, `BookingManager.java` |
| 5 | `SeatMap.java`, `SeatAvailabilityManager.java` |
| 6 | `SeatRecommendationEngine.java` |
| 7 | `WaitlistManager.java`, `RACQueue.java` |
| 8 | `DatabaseManager.java`, SQL Scripts |
| 9 | `AdminDashboard.java`, `AdminManager.java` |
| 10 | `PaymentProcessor.java`, `TicketSummary.java` |

> âœ¨ Each module owner must write and test their components independently before system integration. Shared components like `SeatTree.java` and `DatabaseManager.java` must follow team-agreed interfaces and design contracts.
